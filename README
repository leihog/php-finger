### php-finger ###

A simple php implementation of the finger protocol.
Well part of it anyway. I wrote this to use it with Thimbl,
so I only implemented the parts I needed for that.

Install
-----------

#cp fingerd.php /usr/local/sbin/fingerd.php
#chmod 655 /usr/local/sbin/fingerd.php
#chown root:nobody /usr/local/sbin/fingerd.php

-- inetd
Make sure the file /etc/services contains the line
finger          79/tcp

Add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf
finger stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/local/sbin/fingerd.php

-- xinitd

Add the following to /etc/xinitd.d/finger
service finger
{
    disable = no
    flags = REUSE
    socket_type = stream
    protocol = tcp
    wait = no
    user = nobody
    server = /usr/local/sbin/fingerd.php
}

and then as root run: (might differ depending on OS or dist)
#chkconfig finger on
#service xinetd restart
